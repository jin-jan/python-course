# Homework Assignment #10: Importing

## Details:
 
Pick any library that come with Python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
that we haven't covered in the course already.

Learn how to use the library extensively, then prepare a code sample that
showcases what you've learned. This can take any form you wish. You could
create an application with the library, or just show examples of how to use its methods. 


## Extra Credit:

Share your knowledge with the community by writing a blog post instead of just
uploading a code sample! You don't need to mention this class at all, just share
what you've learned about that library. If you've been meaning to start a coding
blog, now you have a reason to do it! If you take this route, just send us the link
to the post instead of to your Github code,
